#Lean

Lean is a small wordpress-project-theme.
It´s intended for usage with codekit (dependancies and minification/concatenation). Setting up a gruntfile shouldn´t be too hard though.

What I want:
- reduce number of templates
- use wordpress as intended
- take all theme-related features from "functionality plugin" and put it into the according include-files loaded by functions.php
- write shorter sentences
- use best practices from h5bp, bootstrap and friends as much as possible
