#Lean

Lean is a small wordpress-project-theme.
It´s intended for usage with codekit (dependancies and minification/concatenation). Setting up a gruntfile shouldn´t be too hard though.

What it does:

- reduce number of templates
- use wordpress as intended
- take all theme-related features from "functionality plugin" and put it into the according include-files loaded by functions.php
- allow usage of wordpress-like template loading as well as "hardcoded" templates (ie no content-cpt.php)
- simple wordpress setup
- use best practices from h5bp, bootstrap and friends as much as possible
- load minified assets (install via bower, process via codekit/grunt)
- uses jQuery 2 and Bootstrap 3 (downgrade jQuery to 1.x for older browsers, shims for IE8 already included)
- favicon included yay
- minimal markup for a lean start
